## Supported Versions
The plugin has been tested and built with the following components:
- [Terraform] v1.6.1 / [OpenTofu] v1.8.0
- [Bitwarden CLI] v2023.2.0 (if not using the experimental `embedded_client`)
- [Go] 1.23.1 (for development)
- [Docker] 23.0.5 (for development)

The provider likely works with older versions but those haven't been tested.

## Usage

The complete documentation for this provider can be found on the [Terraform Registry docs].

```tf
terraform {
  required_providers {
    bitwarden = {
      source  = "maxlaverse/bitwarden"
      version = ">= 0.10.0"
    }
  }
}

# Configure the Bitwarden Provider
provider "bitwarden" {
  email = "terraform@example.com"

  # If you have the opportunity, you can try out the embedded client which removes the need
  # for a locally installed Bitwarden CLI. Please note that this feature is still considered
  # as experimental, might not work as expected, and is not recommended for production use.
  #
  # experimental {
  #   embedded_client = true
  # }
}

# Create a Bitwarden Login item
resource "bitwarden_item_login" "example" {
  name     = "Example"
  username = "service-account"
  password = "<sensitive>"
}

# or use an existing Bitwarden resource
data "bitwarden_item_login" "example" {
  search = "Example"
}
```

See the [examples](./examples/) directory for more examples.

## Security Considerations

The Terraform Bitwarden provider entirely relies on the [Bitwarden CLI] to interact with Vaults.
When you ask Terraform to *plan* or *apply* changes, the provider downloads the encrypted Vault locally as if you would use the Bitwarden CLI directly.
Currently, the Terraform SDK doesn't offer a way to remove the encrypted Vault once changes have been applied.
The issue [hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk#63] tracks discussions for adding such a feature.

If you want find out more about this file, you can read [Terraform's documentation on Data Storage].
Please note that this file is stored at `<your-project>/.bitwarden/` by default, in order to not interfere with your local Vaults.

NOTE: This whole paragraph doesn't apply to the experimental client, as nothing is stored on disk.

## Developing the Provider

If you wish to work on the provider, you'll first need [Go](http://www.golang.org) installed on your machine (see [Requirements](#requirements) above).

To compile the provider, run `go install`. This will build the provider and put the provider binary in the `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

To generate or update documentation, run `go generate`.

In order to run the full suite of Acceptance tests, start a Vaultwarden server:
```sh
$ make server
```

Then run `make testacc`.

```sh
$ make testacc
```
