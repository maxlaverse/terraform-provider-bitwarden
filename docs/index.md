# Bitwarden Provider

Use the Bitwarden provider to interact with Bitwarden logins, secure notes and folders.
You must configure the provider with the proper credentials before you can use it, and have the [Bitwarden CLI] installed.

## API credentials
In order to interact with your Vault using the Bitwarden Provider Terraform plugin, you need to generate an API key:
1. Connect to your Vault on https://vault.bitwarden.com, or your self-hosted instance
2. Click on "Settings" and then "My Account"
3. Scroll down to the "API Key" section
4. Click on "View API Key" (or maybe another label if it's the first time)
5. Save the API credentials
6. Before running `terraform apply`, export the API credentials as environment variable:

```console
export TF_VAR_bw_client_id=<client_id>
export TF_VAR_bw_client_secret=<client_secret>
export TF_VAR_bw_password=<master_password>
```

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Bitwarden Master Password
variable "bw_password" {
  type        = string
  description = "Bitwarden Master Key"
  sensitive   = true
}

variable "bw_client_id" {
  type        = string
  description = "Bitwarden Client ID"
  sensitive   = true
}

variable "bw_client_secret" {
  type        = string
  description = "Bitwarden Client Secret"
  sensitive   = true
}
```

```terraform
# Provider configuration
terraform {
  required_providers {
    bitwarden = {
      source  = "maxlaverse/bitwarden"
      version = "0.0.1"
    }
  }
  required_version = ">= 1.0.2"
}

provider "bitwarden" {
  master_password = var.bw_password
  client_id       = var.bw_client_id
  client_secret   = var.bw_client_secret
  email           = "test@laverse.net"
  server          = "https://vault.bitwarden.com"
}
```
